ffbrowser is a finger-friendly browser for mobile devices running Linux.

It is based partially on Arora browser, but the whole UI is brand new.
It is designed to be simple and as fast as possible. It features:

* finger scrolling (scroll by moving finger on page contents)
* simplified four-buttons user interface
* joined bookmarks, history and tabs
* fullscreen output
* support for playing flash videos

ffbrowser is based on QtWebKit 2.0 which gives is excellent
standard-compliance and fairly good performance. It's slightly optimized
for small devices by turning some eye-catchy features off.
